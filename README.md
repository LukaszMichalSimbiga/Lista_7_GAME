## Introduction
Do you also think that the standard TIC TAC TOE play is too simple?
Then I think that this version will be more interesting.
## Technologies
In this project I use:
* Python 3.7.9
* tkinter 8.6


## How to run this game

`cd my-project `
2. Install the project's development and runtime requirements:
